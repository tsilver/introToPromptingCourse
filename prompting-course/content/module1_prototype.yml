                Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring 
                human intelligence. Modern AI language models, like the one you're learning to work with, can:

                - "Understand and generate human language"
                - "Answer questions and provide explanations"
                - "Help with writing and analysis"
                - "Engage in back-and-forth conversations"

                - "Doesn't truly \"understand\" like humans do"
                - "Can make mistakes or provide incorrect information"
                - "May exhibit biases from its training data"
                - "Cannot access real-time information"

              ðŸ‘‰ Let's ask the AI a simple question to see how it responds. 
              Watch how it processes our question and provides an answer.

            points:
              - "AI is a tool that can understand and respond to human language"
              - "It works by processing your input (prompt) and generating appropriate responses"
              - "The quality of the response depends on how well you communicate with it"
              - "Always verify important information from AI responses"
