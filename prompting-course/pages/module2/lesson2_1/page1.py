    ### Learning Through Examples
    
    Few-shot prompting is a powerful technique where you provide examples to guide the AI's responses. 
    In this lesson, you'll learn:
    - How to create effective example sets
    - When to use few-shot prompting
    - Best practices for pattern matching
    - Techniques for maintaining consistency

    # Key Concepts

    ### Understanding Few-Shot Prompting
    
    Few-shot prompting works by showing the AI examples of:
    1. **Input**: What you might ask
    2. **Output**: How you want it answered
    3. **Pattern**: The consistent structure to follow
    
    This helps the AI understand exactly how you want it to respond to similar questions.
