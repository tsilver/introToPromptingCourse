    ### Mastering Role-Based Prompts
    
    In this lesson, you'll learn how to use personas and roles to:
    - Control the AI's writing style and tone
    - Get expertise-specific responses
    - Maintain consistent character voice
    - Achieve specific communication goals
    
    Role-based prompting helps you get responses tailored to specific contexts and audiences.

    # Key Concepts
    st.markdown("""
    ### Understanding Persona Prompting
    
    A persona prompt includes:
    1. **Role Definition**: Who the AI should act as
    2. **Expertise Level**: Required knowledge depth
    3. **Communication Style**: Tone and language approach
    4. **Target Audience**: Who the response is for
    
    This helps shape both the content and delivery of the AI's response.
