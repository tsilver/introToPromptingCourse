    ### Mastering Prompt Iteration
    
    In this lesson, you'll learn how to:
    - Systematically improve prompts
    - Identify and fix common issues
    - Test and evaluate responses
    - Optimize for specific goals
    
    Iterative refinement is key to developing effective prompts.

    ### The Iteration Process
    
    1. **Initial Design**
       - Base prompt creation
       - Goal definition
       - Success criteria
       - Output requirements
    
    2. **Testing & Analysis**
       - Response evaluation
       - Error identification
       - Pattern recognition
       - Edge case testing
    
    3. **Refinement Steps**
       - Targeted improvements
       - Constraint adjustments
       - Format optimization
       - Clarity enhancements
