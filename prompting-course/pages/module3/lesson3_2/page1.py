    ### Understanding AI Hallucinations
    
    In this lesson, you'll learn how to:
    - Identify AI-generated misinformation
    - Implement fact-checking strategies
    - Use verification techniques
    - Reduce hallucination risks
    
    AI hallucinations are instances where models generate plausible-sounding but false information.

    ### Types of AI Hallucinations
    
    1. **Factual Hallucinations**
       - False statistics
       - Incorrect dates
       - Made-up events
       - Nonexistent sources
    
    2. **Logical Hallucinations**
       - Invalid reasoning
       - False correlations
       - Impossible scenarios
       - Contradictory statements
    
    3. **Contextual Hallucinations**
       - Misapplied knowledge
       - Mixed-up references
       - Temporal confusion
       - Spatial inconsistencies
