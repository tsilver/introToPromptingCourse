    Now let's explore more sophisticated techniques for:
    - Systematic bias detection
    - Intersectional bias analysis

    ### Complex Bias Patterns
    
    1. **Intersectional Bias**
       - Multiple demographic factors
       - Compounded stereotypes
       - Hidden assumptions
       - Overlapping prejudices
    
    2. **Contextual Bias**
       - Situational stereotypes
       - Domain-specific assumptions
       - Regional variations
       - Temporal context
    
    3. **Systemic Bias**
       - Institutional patterns
       - Historical inequities
       - Power dynamics
       - Structural barriers
