    ### What is AI?
    
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring 
    human intelligence. Modern AI language models, like the one you're learning to work with, can:
    
    - Understand and generate human language
    - Answer questions and provide explanations
    - Help with writing and analysis
    - Engage in back-and-forth conversations
    
    However, AI also has important limitations. It:
    - Doesn't truly "understand" like humans do
    - Can make mistakes or provide incorrect information
    - May exhibit biases from its training data
    - Cannot access real-time information

    - AI is a tool that can understand and respond to human language
